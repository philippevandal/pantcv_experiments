### Main workflow
def main():
    # Get options
    args = options()

    # Read image
    img, path, filename = pcv.readimage(args.image)

    pcv.params.debug=args.debug #set debug mode

    # STEP 1: Check if this is a night image, for some of these dataset's images were captured
    # at night, even if nothing is visible. To make sure that images are not taken at
    # night we check that the image isn't mostly dark (0=black, 255=white).
    # if it is a night image it throws a fatal error and stops the workflow.

    if np.average(img) < 50:
        pcv.fatal_error("Night Image")
    else:
        pass

    # STEP 2: Normalize the white color so you can later
    # compare color between images.
    # Inputs:
    #   img = image object, RGB colorspace
    #   roi = region for white reference, if none uses the whole image,
    #         otherwise (x position, y position, box width, box height)

    # white balance image based on white toughspot

    img1 = pcv.white_balance(img=img,roi=(400,800,200,200))

    # STEP 3: Rotate the image
    # Inputs:
    #   img = image object, RGB color space
    #   rotation_deg = Rotation angle in degrees, can be negative, positive values 
    #                  will move counter-clockwise 
    #   crop = If True then image will be cropped to original image dimensions, if False
    #          the image size will be adjusted to accommodate new image dimensions 


    rotate_img = pcv.rotate(img=img1,rotation_deg=-1, crop=False)

    # STEP 4: Shift image. This step is important for clustering later on.
    # For this image it also allows you to push the green raspberry pi camera
    # out of the image. This step might not be necessary for all images.
    # The resulting image is the same size as the original.
    # Inputs:
    #   img    = image object
    #   number = integer, number of pixels to move image
    #   side   = direction to move from "top", "bottom", "right","left"

    shift1 = pcv.shift_img(img=img1, number=300, side='top')
    img1 = shift1

    # STEP 5: Convert image from RGB colorspace to LAB colorspace
    # Keep only the green-magenta channel (grayscale)
    # Inputs:
    #    img     = image object, RGB colorspace
    #    channel = color subchannel ('l' = lightness, 'a' = green-magenta , 'b' = blue-yellow)

    #    threshold   = threshold value (0-255)
    #    max_value   = value to apply above threshold (usually 255 = white)
    #    object_type = light or dark
    #       - If object is light then standard thresholding is done
    #       - If object is dark then inverse thresholding is done

    img_binary = pcv.threshold.binary(img=a, threshold=120, max_value=255, object_type='dark')

    #                                     adjust this value

    # STEP 7: Fill in small objects (speckles)
    # Inputs:
    #    bin_img  = image object, binary. img will be returned after filling
    #    size = minimum object area size in pixels (integer)

    #                           adjust this value

    # STEP 8: Dilate so that you don't lose leaves (just in case)
    # Inputs:
    #    img    = input image
    #    ksize  = kernel size
    #    i      = iterations, i.e. number of consecutive filtering passes

    dilated = pcv.dilate(gray_img=fill_image, ksize=1, i=1)

    # STEP 9: Find objects (contours: black-white boundaries)
    # Inputs:

    #    mask = what is used for object detection

    #    y_adj     = adjust center along y axis
